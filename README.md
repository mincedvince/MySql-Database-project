# MySql-Database-project

You will be using a MySql database hosted on UWâ€™s shared server (such as vergil.u.washington.edu), you may use the PHP reference (css475php). This is a simplified PHP client-server application that generates HTML webpages. The files of project would be stored in a subdirectory of public_html or student_html folders on UW servers. You will need to customize the config.inc.php file for your DBMS specific parameters much in the same way as you customized the configuration file for PhpMyAdmin. PHP code calls the mysqli database layer to interact with MySql database.
